## PHP labs and exploits for LFI with Race condition cases
### Assignments for hands-on exploration of PHP vulnerabilities. 

### Nracer
---
#### Exploiting Nginx buffering using procfs. Exploiting realpath_cache and ways to bypass (... deleted) in realpath

### Zlibber
---
#### Exploiting compress.zlib/zlib to obtain ssrf/lfi and then obtain RCE via race condition

### Progresser
---
#### 1. Exploiting php upload_progress using race condition and lfi followed by rce
